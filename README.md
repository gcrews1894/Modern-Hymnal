## Launching the Development Environment

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can verify this by running `node -v` in your terminal. If Node.js is installed, this command will display the installed version.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. This is typically done with the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Please note that the exact command may vary depending on the scripts defined in your `package.json`.

5. Your development server should now be running, and you can view your application by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL provided in your terminal
